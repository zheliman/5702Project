Although the commencement would not be held until next May, some students would like to plan ahead and reserve accommodation for their parents and friends to stay. Compare to hotel, Airbnb, the largest peer-to-peer exchange service for hospitality around the world, is arguably a more budget-friendly choice for short-term visitors. Moreover, some services at Airbnb, such as kitchen usage, might only be available in those high-end hotels, which provides an advantage over staying at the hotel. As a result, we would like to investigate the NYC Airbnb dataset, specifically rental prices range from 100 to 400, and propose the following three questions: (1) How would price of a listed property correlate with the housing type in the New York City? (2) How would seasonality affect the price of the listed property? (3) How are superhosts different from non superhosts? Note: superhosts are experienced hosts who provide a shining example for other hosts, and extraordinary experiences for their guests. 1.1 A quick glance of Airbnb in New York City There are overall 48377 unique listing in NYC and the first rental listed in NYC was up in August 22, 2008. Over 1.16 million reviews have been written by guests since then The price for a listing ranges from $10 per night to $10000 per night Fun Fact: One listing has 40 beds and one host has total listing count of 1611 "],
["section-data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We downloaded the New York City Airbnb datasets, including listings.csv.gz, calendar.csv.gz, reviews.csv.gz, neighbourhoods.geojson and etc., from the Airbnb open data source: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. listings.csv.gz: a detailed listing data for New York City, which entails features such as rental prices per night, host information, geological location, housing features, and availabilities. The majority part of data usage in our report come from this csv file. calendar.csv.gz: a detailed calendar data for listings in New York City, which was used for our seasonality analysis. reviews.csv.gz: a detailed review data for listings in New York City. We built our wordcloud based upon this dataset. neighbourhoods.geojson: a GeoJSON file of neighbourhoods of the city. We mainly use it to visualize our maps and develop a shiny app. listings.csv: a brief summary of information and metrics for listings in New York City, which was used in our preliminary summary statistics; however, due to the limited features in the dataset, we did not focus on this csv file. neighbourhoods.csv: a neighbourhood list for geo filter. It is sourced from city or open source GIS files and we use it to get a better understanding of the counties and districts in New York City. "],
["section-data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation the original dataset listings.csv.gz has 48377 observations and 106 variables. We first went over each column and decided to drop the ones that we were for sure not going to examine. This resulted in a dataset of 48377 observations and 78 variables. We first look at the number of missing values in the dataset and ranked the variables with N/A’s in descending order with respect to number of N/A’s. We noticed that variables such as license, square_feet, and weekly_price have more than 40000 missing values, so we would want to drop those columns with more than 40000 N/A’s. ## X8 X13 ## 48377 48377 ## X49 license ## 48377 48377 ## jurisdiction_names square_feet ## 48377 47999 ## monthly_price weekly_price ## 43376 42625 ## security_deposit review_scores_location ## 16924 10619 ## review_scores_value review_scores_checkin ## 10618 10615 ## review_scores_accuracy review_scores_communication ## 10598 10595 ## review_scores_cleanliness review_scores_rating ## 10583 10561 ## cleaning_fee first_review ## 10234 9651 ## last_review reviews_per_month ## 9651 9651 ## host_neighbourhood zipcode ## 6232 662 ## host_location city ## 175 69 ## bathrooms bedrooms ## 48 41 ## beds host_since ## 36 21 ## host_response_rate host_is_superhost ## 21 21 ## host_listings_count host_total_listings_count ## 21 21 ## host_has_profile_pic host_identity_verified ## 21 21 ## name neighbourhood ## 16 12 ## state ## 3 We want to also remove the columns with only 1 unique values as containing only 1 value is not likely to affect our result We want to change some variables to our desired data type. For instance, price, security deposit, cleaning_fee and extra_people are in character type with a dollar sign $ and two decimal places for cents after, so we would like to change them to numeric type and drop the dollar signs in both listings.csv.gz and calendar.csv.gz. We applied the same procedure to change the variables in percentage form to numeric. For the Dates such as host_since, first_review, and last_review, we changed them from character type to Date type so we could use time-series directly. Moreover, we changed character variables such as neighbourhood, property_type, and room_type to factor as we believed it would be easier to facet while graphing in ggplot. Further, we remove the observations with price equals to 0 since we consider it uncommon and unreasonable to stay over without paying. Same reasoning applied to host_listings_count, and host_total_listings_count since those two variables can not be 0 while the corresponding listings appeared in the dataset. The resulting dataset has 46386 observations and 66 variables. "],
["section-missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Some featuers such as security_deposit and review_scores_communication still have approximately 10000 missing data while other features such as host_response_rate and neighbourhood have minimal missing data compared to the total number of rows. There are two reasons that we did not impute or fill the missing values in those variables: It is hard to infer a value for those missing cells. For instance, the following gg_miss_upset graph reveals that varaibles regarding review scores are likely to miss altogehter. We could not fill a missing cell in review_scores_cleanliness by finding the correlation between review_scores_cleanliness and the other review_scores subsection. Therefore, instead of taking a wild guess, we would rather keep them as N/A’s. For the ones with minimal missing values such as bathrooms, beds, and neighbourhood, as we can see from the plot below, their missing perentage are very close to 0. Hence, when we conduct data analysis to investigate our problems, we could simply omit those observations without affecting our general patterns. We did not remove those observations since we want to retain the completeness of our dataset. "],
["section-analysis-of-calendar-data.html", "Chapter 5 Analysis of Calendar Data 5.1 Analysis of Seasonality and Time Effect 5.2 Booked Housing VS. Available Listing 5.3 Average Price Comparison based on Weekdays", " Chapter 5 Analysis of Calendar Data 5.1 Analysis of Seasonality and Time Effect We want to analyze the seasonality of Airbnb housing prices using the calendar dataset. The variable available denotes the availability of every Airbnb listing in New York area from 9/12/2019 to 9/11/2020. Since customers always have general judgement about the overall quality of the housing, those booked listings can be perceived as being more likely to be fairly priced and reflect the price condition of rental market in New York area. When we want to book a house, we usually search through most of possible listings to find the optimal choice. So analyzing booked housing can better help us to make decision. 5.1.1 Time effect on demand This time series plot analyzed the sum of booked housing from 9/12/19 to 9/11/20. Using the time seires plot, we can see two outliers on 9/12/2019 and 9/11/20 which are the first and last days of our data. The existence of these could be due to data collecting issues and we can reasonably ignore these two data points in our analysis below. Although the booked housing quantity is not equivalent to the actual checkin amount and many people prefer to book housing within one month of departure, we can still analyze the sum of booked housing data as there already exists some clear pattern in the plot. Starting from 9/13/19 when the sum of booked housing reaches its peak, the amount of booked housing gradually decreases until mid November. This happens because the rental condition on 9/13/19 is closest to the actual check-in amount. As time get further away from today, there will be more potential customers who may plan but have not yet booked an Airbnb right now. Given the stable level of housing demand on October, the downward trend looks reasonable. After mid November, the amount of rental gradually increases and reaches its local peak on 12/30/19. Then, the amount sharply declines. This transition can be safely interpreted by the advent of New Year’s day. The sum of rental remains stable afterwards but there is an immediate rise on 3/10/20, which is exactly the starting time of spring break. Another immediate rise happens on 6/8/20 which is the start of summer vacation. Apparently, the demand of housing is strongly related with long holidays. Those holidays largely increase the demand of Airbnb housing in New York area, which partly reflect the popularity of New York area as a traveling place. Also, leasing contracts of at least 3 months may contribute to the stability of rented housing as the lines are almost horizontal for each time interval between dashed lines. Overall, the advent of long holidays can largely increase the demand of housing. Because of the limitation of total amount of Airbnb listing in New York, the higher amount of booked housing means the lower availability of high quality houses. Theoretically, the higher demand leads to the higher price. So we can further analyze the price in a year to confirm our conclusion. 5.1.2 Time effect on price The time series plot above shows the variability of price in a change. Same as above, we do not analyze two outliers because of data collection issues. First, we can find a huge increment in average price at the end of the year. The price starts to increase from the middle of Decmember and reaches its maximum on 12/28/2019. After New Year’s Day, the price turns back to normal level. Since the demand of housing is positively related to its price, such increase in price reflects the steep rise in housing demand. It can be attributed to the start of winter break and the popularity of traveling to New York for celebrating New Year’s Day. Also, there is a price drift around the middle of March. It corresponds to the beginning of spring break and the popularity of New York city as the traveling destination at that time. The average price of listing vibrates a lot from October to December. We can observe that the price reaches its minimum on 11/18/19. The price remains stable and comparatively low from mid January to mid March. The price is also stable but slightly higher after April. So based on this plot, all of the observations are consistent to the demand change analyzed before. According to the price data, we find that The most expensive timing is from mid December to mid January. On the other hand, the most economical timing for booking Airbnb housing is November, January and Februray which are most suitable time to travel to New York if we want to minimize the rental expense. 5.2 Booked Housing VS. Available Listing 5.2.1 Mean price comparison Because of the family budget constraint, we only looked at the housings with price larger than 100 dollars and lower than 400 dollars. From the boxplot above, the booked properties have lower mean price than unbooked ones. The interquartile range for booked housings are largely smaller than that of availble housings. The boxplot gives us an overview about the relationship between availability and price. We still need to analyze further in detail. 5.2.2 Proportion Comparison with Binned Price We bin the price to six levels: $101-$150, $151-$200, $201-$250, $251-$300, $301-$350, $351-$400. It helps us better visualize availability proportion for different quality levels of properties. We can see that as price goes up, the proportion of booked properties gets gradually smaller. The price interval $101-$150 has highest proportion of booked housing which is around 75% while the price interval $351-$400 has lowest proportion which is around 50%. Also, about 40% of housing are priced between $101-$150 and about 80% of housing are priced between $101-$300. As price gets higher, the count of housing gets smaller and smaller. So if we want to lower the rental cost, we need to book the housing as early as possible because cheaper housings are always first to be booked and the available listings are generally more expensive. Even though we want to find a good housing with price between $301-$400, it would be much better to plan ahead as there are much samller number of listings and over half of total properties in this price interval have already been booked. 5.2.3 Minimum night We also take a deeper look at the relationship between binned minimum night and availability of Airbnb housing. We created four levels of minimum nights: “Below 3”, “3-6”, “7-9”, “Above 10”. About 60% of housings have minimum nights below 3. It makes sense as Airbnb mainly provides short term rental. For these housings, about 75% has already been booked. Around 20% of housings have minimum nights between 3 to 6. The count of housings with minimum nights between 7 to 9 is lowest among all levels. The proportion of availability for these two types are similar and lowest among all levels. Surprisingly to us, around 20% of housings have minimum nights above 10 days. The proportion of booking rate of this type, which is smaller than 50%, is lowest among all four levels. 5.3 Average Price Comparison based on Weekdays The ridgeline plot above shows the average price distribution for different weekdays from 9/12/19 to 9/11/20. The y axis is ordered by the average price of peaks on each weekday. The graph clearly shows that the average price distributions are quite similar for all of weekdays. Also, from Sunday to Thursday, all of their average price density curves have peaks on the similar average price while there exhibits an obvious right shift of curves on Friday and Saturday. This pattern can be explained by the lodging demands when people from other cities travel to New York on weekends. The higher on Friday but not on Sunday may be explained by visitors’ preference to arrive in New York on Friday night. They can not live in New York on Sunday as they may work or take classes on Monday. "],
["section-analysis-for-superhost.html", "Chapter 6 Analysis for Superhost 6.1 preliminary analysis 6.2 Benefits of becomming a superhost: 6.3 How to become a supper_host", " Chapter 6 Analysis for Superhost 6.1 preliminary analysis First we look at the price distribution over five county in New York. The distribution is quickly diminished at around 200, which means majority renting price is below 200. If we categrate houses with renting price below 100 as lower tier and above 100 as higher tier. We find that Bronx and Queens have many lower tier houses while Manhattan has houses concentrate more on higher end. This make sence, cause Manhattan is more convinient to travel in New York, and has more entertainment facilities. However, the difference between five conties is not as large as we thought. We want to analyze whether the high price in Manhattan is because of the high demand. So we want to analyze the demand by number of reviews per house. What picks our interests is that when we calculate the average view per house in five different locations, we find that Manhattan which has the highest price recieve lowest number of reviews per house. Next we want to analyze the correlation between price and the number of reviews. So we draw a scatter plot to view the correlation. Because there are many extreme price and reviews, therefore, it is hard to see the correlation. However, it seems that price of the houses is in inverse proportion to number of reviews, which means that the more review the house has, the less price it has, and vice versa. 6.2 Benefits of becomming a superhost: In order to find the benefit of superhost, we need to answer two questions. First is whether super hosts set higher price than none super host, second question is whether supper host’s house recieve more reviews than none super host. 6.2.1 Whether superhost set higher price? In order to answer the first question, we want to minimize other factors that influence price at first. According to the analysis above, location can influence price. Because we want to recommend houses for students’ parents in Columbia, so we focus the location on Manhattan. Another factor we want to take a look at that will influence price is room_type. In the above graph, it shows that room_type indeed influnce the price. Entire home/apt has the highest price while shared room has the lowest price. This result reminds us that, we should exclude room_type features. Then we need to know the geographical distribution of super host. We want to know whether super host is related with geographical location. If it does, we need to rule out that influence. The graph above shows that the distribution between total_host, super_host, none_super_host. The x axis is the percentage of houses in a district. It seems that the distribution for super host and none super host between different district is approximately the same. So we don’t need to rule out location factor. Now we can study the influence of super host on price, by focusing on Manhattan and specific room_type. The result is that superhost can set higher price for Hotel_room type, other room_type is not different between super host and none superhost. Because For Private room, Entire home/apt and Shared room, the distribution between super host and none super host is the same. By contrast we know that for Hotel room, the influence from host_type is truely exist. 6.2.2 Whether superhost recieve more attention than none superhost Second question we want to ask is whether super host’s house will recieve more review. We take the same steps as the first question. We first rule out other fatcors which will influence review. We do this by classify the house by location and room type, and then we see whether there is difference between superhosts and none superhosts. The result shows that superhost will recieve more reviews for private room, entire home/apt and shared room. 6.3 How to become a supper_host We want to give suggestions about how can host become super host, we want to analyze the question from three aspect. First is whether owning more houses will make you a super host, second is what cancellation policy does most super host have, third is what type of score should the host take more attention to than other scores. 6.3.1 Whether host should put more house on it? This graph represents how many houses does each host has. the size of the buble represent the number of houses per host have. We facet this graph to two graph using host_type features to see the difference between super host and none super host. First conclusion we get is that the range of number of houses is large. The highest is amount to 400 plus and the lowest is just 1. However, the number of houses one post is not a determining factor, it is true that superhost tend to hold more houses, but majority of hosts only have less than ten houses. Although having less than 20 houses is not a strong indicator of being a superhost. Having 20 and more houses is a strong indicator of being a super host. We suspect that it is because more houses one have means more time the owner will spend on renting service, which means more thoughtful service. 6.3.2 What cancellation policy should host choose? We visualize three variables in this graph. There are five kind of policies for cancellation. Before look at the data, we tend to think that superhost tend to have a more flexible cancellation policy, because it makes sense that more flexible means more satisfaction. However, the graph indicates that strict policy with 14 grace period is actually the most frequent policy super host choose. We suspect the reason be that superhost tend to focus on costumer experience, so that they are confident that it is not their fault to cause cancellation, so they make stricter cancellation policy. 6.3.3 What kind of scores should the host pay more attention? We want to know which feature is more sensitive to customers. The measurment method is by calculating variance of the score for each features. The justification is that, the more variance one feature has, the more consideration from customer it includes. If all of the score is one hundred, it either means fake posts, or this feature is hard to tell the difference from customer. However, if the data is distributed from 0 to 100 in a bell shaped curve, it means that customer can tell the difference and it is worth more attention from the host to improve that. However, bell shape is just in theory, generally speaking, the shape can be in many forms. The result is that cleanliness has the largest variance and therefore, most sensitive to customers. The word cloud we build on the comments of customers reveals that clean is a frequent word in comments, which corespond to our finding that cleanliness is the most important feature customer cares. We first calculate the mean score for five features between super host and none superhost, but the mean scores are hard to tell the difference, we suspect it is because there are so many full score which interfere the analysis. So we want to analyze on the perspective of unsatisfactory rate. We define unsatisfatory rate as the percentage of scores that are under 95% of the full score. The justification is that full score hardly reveal any information, because no such things as perfect. There always will be a way to improve. Generally speaking, there are two circumstances for full score rating, first is out of exaggeration, second is fake post. So we decide to only focus on the score which is much lower that is enough to reveal some shortages of the houses. It turns out 95% is a good cut off which will reveal us some significant findings. The y axis represent unsatisfactory rate for superhost and none superhost. Generally speaking, superhost did better on accuracy, chekin and communication. For cleanliness and location, superhost and none superhost both have room of improvement, although superhost has less unsatisfactory customers than none superhost. "],

With the help of library ‘leaflet’, we try to merge different layers into one single map to exhaustively analysis the correlation between home building factors and the location factors. As we can see in the map, the map concludes different layers. We can easily display or remove the layer by clicking the check buttons before the layer’s names. We can use the combination of different layers to show different correlation patterns: 7.1 Study of Variable ‘Room type’ By clicking only the ‘Room_type’, we can display all the listing data on the map to show its geographical distribution. From the map we can find that homes with room type as ‘Entire home/apt’ and ‘Private room’ tend to be the two most common types of the rental house type accross New York. Meanwhile, the rental houses are evernly distributted across Manhattan and Brooklyn except in the Staten Island, Bronx and and Queens.We think that this is due to the geographical restriction or the lack number of tourists. By changing the base map into ‘Satellite’, we can see from the map that there are certain desolate areas in the western and northwestern side in the Staten Island. This happens to be the area that rental houses are not located, which explains the unevenly distribution of the rental houses in Staten Island. In Bronx and Queens, the areas that do not have rental houses are those areas which are remote from downtown areas. The lack of tourists may lead to this situation. 7.2 Study of Variable ‘Room count’ By clicking only the ‘Room_count’, we can get summary of the number of listing data that locates in different neighbourhoods in New York City. From the legend shown in the lower left, we can see that larger values come with deeper color. Meanwhile, we can click the neighbourhoods on map to get its name with the summary value. From the map we can find that the number of rental houses in Williamsburg, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem is comparing larger than the rest of the counties. Tourists may be interested in these neighborhood because of its history and its beautiful brownstones(Bedford-Stuyvesant). Meanwhile, we can find that the number of rental houses in Manhattan is greater than the rest of the areas. It may due to the convenience of the transition and the high population. Besides, we are interesed to find that the areas with greater number corresponds with subway line presence. 7.3 Study of Variable ‘Room_rate’ By clicking only the ‘Room_rate’, we can get summary of the average rate of listing data that locates in different neighbourhoods in New York City. We can find out that the average rating for all the rental house is high. In Staten island, the areas close to the State Park have the high scores. Brooklyn neighborhoods close to Manhattan tend to have higher scores. However, rental houses in Manhattan usually have comparing lower rate than others on map. We think that it may due to the comparing higher rental price in Manhattan, which make the houses’ value comparing less reasonable. 7.4 Study of Variable ‘Room_price’ By clicking only the ‘Room_price’, we can get summary of the average price of listing data that locates in different neighbourhoods in New York City. We can find that the couties that have comparing more expensive houses are usually near water. After investgating, we find that there are certain castles in Staten Island that are available for renting, which explains the high average price. We can find that the average home price in Mahattan is comparing greater than the others, this conclusion can be confirmed when we review the ‘Price_heatmap’ map. Typically in Manhattan, the average price of rental house in downtown are comparing larger than the midtown and more north areas. Considering of the convenience of the transition, price of the rental houses and number of available renting lists, upper east side, upper west side or morningside height would be good areas for parents to stay.

["section-summary.html", "Chapter 9 Summary 9.1 Conclusion 9.2 Limitation: 9.3 Further Improvement and Future Direction:", " Chapter 9 Summary 9.1 Conclusion From this exploratory data analysis and visualization project, we gained a better understanding of the Airbnb rental market in New York City. After performing some data analysis, we have summrize the answers to our proposed questions as following: How would seasonality affect the price of the listed property? The demand of Airbnb housings in New York area is largely affected by long breaks. The demand exhibits immediate increase at the beginning of winter, spring and summer vacations. Correspondingly, the average prices steeply increase during these days. Also, the mean prices vary on weekdays. The prices on Friday and Saturday are higher than any of those from Sunday to Thursday. According to the calendar data, we discover that cheaper Airbnb housing are much more popular than more expensive ones in New York as well. In conclusion, it is more economical to avoid long vacations and weekends to travel to New York if we can flexibly design our traveling schedule and book housing as early as possible. How are superhosts different from non superhosts? When look at the review scores concerning cleanliness, communication, location, checkin, accuracy, superhost beat none superhost in every aspect. That means super host provide better services for customer. Take a deeper look, we find that super host did especially well on accuracy, checkin and communication, while for cleanliness and location, both superhost and none superhost have a lot of room for improvement. Superhost tend to have more strict cancellation policy with 14 grace period, and none superhost tend to have either strict or flexible cancellation policy. As for the price set by superhost, superhost set higher price regarding to Hotel type houses compare with none superhost. We suspect that hotel need credibility, and superhost is a credibility for the host. Superhost tend to recieve more attention compare with none superhost, according to the review number for host property. How would location factors affect rental houses? For house numbers, neighborhoods that are full of history and beautiful brownstones or have convenience of the transition and the high population are likely to have greater numbers. Besides, we are interesed to find that the areas with greater number corresponds with subway line presence. For house prices, neighborhoods that are convenient of the transition usually have higher prices. Overall, the rating and price of rental houses in New York City is comparing high. In Staten island, the areas close to the State Park have the high scores. Brooklyn neighborhoods close to Manhattan tend to have higher scores. 9.2 Limitation: We only use one year calendar data. There might exist some bias on data if we only use one year data to analyze seasonality effect. The distribution of the rental houses can not fully cover the range of New York City. There exists situations that the coordinate system data does not match with the real location. The web render is not fast enough due to the large number of observations in the data. There are many factors influence the price, however, due to the limitation of time, we just study two features which are location and room_type. For example, property type and cancellation policy might affect price. if we can control these variable the same and only make host the changing variable, the result will be more convincing. When we analyze the benefit of super host, we first analyze the price that super host set, second analyze the review super host recieve. However, review is not a strong indicater of the attention recieved. For example, some customer would not give review, and some review might be fake. The best indicator for the attention recieved is the total amount of contract make. Because contract is more authentic compare with review. When analzing how can one person become a superhost, we only give three suggestions. However, there are many features remain to be analyzed for example bed type and property type. 9.3 Further Improvement and Future Direction: There are two major areas we want to improve on. The first major area is on data cleaning. If we want to examine questions regarding security_deposit or host_response_rate, which contain large amount of N/A’s, we could try to run regression or predictive modeling on other related features to fill out the N/A’s. In addtion, the utilization of “merging preditors” is a starting point in our mind. For instance, cleaning_fee is a mandatory fee charged to the subletters, but it is not included in the listed price. In order to figure out the actual cost of each night of stay, we could merge the variable cleaning_fee and price to get a new column acutal_price, which would improve the accuracy of our result. We would also want to improve the interactivity of some of our graphs. For instance, we could build a shiny wordcloud, which enables us to filter the desired frequencies. We want to expand our analysis by including some variables that haven’t used in our project and potentially including some outside data resoureces such as the New York City metro data and crime rate data. By incorporating the metro dataset, we can analyze how would transportation affects the price per stay. Intuitively, if an Airbnb is hosted near metro lanes, the price is likely to be higher and we would want to verify that. Also, a high crime rate might imply a lower price and lower occupancy rate. Last but not least, we plan to add more features to our shinyapp. For example, we could add options to calculate the total cost of staying, which includes the price of staying per se, the cleaning fee as well as the extra guests, and our price sliderbar would reflect the actual price.
